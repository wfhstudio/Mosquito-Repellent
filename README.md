# Mosquito-Repellent
31 Khz for Mosquito and 40 Khz for Dog

Material
1 x Arduino Nano
2 x Buzzer
2 x LED (Blue and Red)
2 x 10K Resistor

Connection
Buzzer 1 = D12
Buzzer 2 = D7
LED Red = D4 (using 10K Resistor before connecting to D4)  i.e. D4 ---> 10K Resistor ---> + LED 
LED Blue = D3 (using 10K Resistor before connecting to D3) i.e. D3 ---> 10K Resistor ---> + LED
